### Program Presentations

Here is a link to a google doc in which you can choose a time.

I have to go out of town in the morning, so I can only meet from 12:00 on.

### What I expect

I expect to view programs 4-7 working on a laptop, or on a lab computer. If you received a 0 (zero) on a previous program do not ask me to re-grade it **unless** we have a previous agreement.

I will not give you time to debug or fix your programs while you are showing them to me. You should be prepared to show all expected programs the minute we begin the meeting. There will be no code editing, only running. I don't care how minor the fix.

I will use a checklist (rubric) to grade each program, so there will be no negotiation.

### Your Grade

You will know your grade when the meeting is over, **however** I will still check for collusion between students and or groups. In the case that you are found to be colluding with other students (not in your group) will receive an "F" in the course.
