## Multiplayer Fun

### Overview

At present the example code [here] creates a multiplayer environment, however it is missing a couple of key elements, namely multiple players! You will need to add the necessary changes to the client and server that displays each additional player. In class we already discussed the existing communication done between client and server, and we discovered that the server tells each player about all other players, but that as a client finds out about a player, it never actually creates an instance of the player object. So you will need to remedy that problem.
