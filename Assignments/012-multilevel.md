## MultiLevel Fun
- **Due**: July 8<sup>th</sup> by class time.
- **Late Projects:** Will NOT be graded. 

### Guidelines
- Projects that are not on github, will not be graded. 
- Projects that do not run, will not be graded.
- You can work in groups of 2-3 not 4. Don't ask.
- All work is expected to be done solely by the individuals in the group. Any collaboration with other groups will result in a grade of 0 (zero) on the assignment.
- Each project will also contain a references file called `references.md` in which all websites in which your group obtianed example code from will be listed in a numbered list.
- Your program will be commented, and again, any help obtained should be cited in the comments.
