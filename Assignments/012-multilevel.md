## MultiLevel Fun
- **Due**: July 8<sup>th</sup> by class time.
- **Late Projects:** Will NOT be graded. 

### Guidelines
- Projects that are not on github, will not be graded. 
- Projects that do not run, will not be graded.
- You can work in groups of 2-3 not 4. Don't ask.
- All work is expected to be done solely by the individuals in the group. Any collaboration with other groups will result in a grade of 0 (zero) on the assignment.
- Each project will also contain a references file called `references.md` in which all websites in which your group obtianed example code from will be listed in a numbered list.
- Your program will be commented, and again, any help obtained should be cited in the comments.

### Requirements

- Using a previous version of the coin game wich includes:
    - A character that moves around and captures coins
    - Each coin adds to the players score
- Add another level such that:
    - When the player drops through the floor it will start the new level
    - The new level will look noticeably different from the previous level
    - The new level will show the current score (not zero)
- When the player dies, the combined score (a total) from both levels will show. 
    - Basically don't lose the score between levels or when the game ends.
