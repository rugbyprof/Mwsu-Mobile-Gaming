## Random Map Generation

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3Y0P3B1U1W2u2N1E2z3D/random_map.png)

Random maze generation is a "thing". Check it out on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm). We are going to incorporate this method to create a random "world" for us to play in. The idea came to me because I want to employ the A-Star algorithm to have NPC's (Non Player Character) chase a player (or at least "stalk" the player). We could use this that Phaser provides us: [Accelerate To Object](http://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/accelerate-to-object), and we might, but we also need the NPC to go around objects, and that's where [A-Star](https://github.com/prettymuchbryce/easystarjs) comes in.

### Game Ideas

- Drop Claymore
- As the player reaches rooms in your maze, load a tile map for a fight against the enemy who chases you. The enemy can gain new "powers" each time you defeat him.
- Map visibility
    1. Full visibility in player's immediate view
    2. Memory/partial visibility of areas player has seen before
    3. no visibility of areas player has not yet seen
- let the player be able to take a certain number of hits before dying (with a life bar).
- Have random power ups that the player can pickup in the dungeon. Examples: invisibility, shield, speed up, slow down time/stop time.
