Your github repository and your server contain copies of all your programs. When you turn in an assignment, it gets uploaded to your server and gets pushed to github. If you edit your code on github, the data/time saved is changed. Likewise, if you edit your code on the server the date/time edited changes as well (see above). I cannot distinguish between changes made via experimentation or changes made to fix a program that was not finished. So if you don't want your programs to be counted late, leave them alone.

Look at the directory above, it has "Program-1" through "Program-N". Your github repo should have (the starting of) a similar structure. Once you finish `Program-x` leave it alone. If you want to experiment, do the following:

- `cp -r Program-x Program-x-playground` or 
- `cp -r Program-x someother-folder`. 

Now the assignment....

## Last of the Addons
- **Due**: June 16<sup>th</sup> by class time.
- **Late Projects:** Will NOT be graded. 

### Guidelines
- Projects that are not on github, will not be graded. 
- Projects that do not run, will not be graded.
- You can work by yourself (no groups).
- All work is expected to be done solely by the individual. Any collaboration with other individuals will result in a grade of 0 (zero) on the assignment.

### Important
- You need to have a copy of your code in your repository and on their server. 
- To finalize your submission, send me an email with the following information:
- **Subject:** 2D Program 3
- The body of your email will contain your name, a link to the assignment on your server, and a link to your github repo.
- Example email below:

>Subject: 2D Program 3
>
>Name John Smith<br>
Here are the links for my assignment:<br>

### Actual Assignment

- Starter code [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mwsu-Mobile-Gaming/blob/master/Example_code/Program-3-Starter.zip) if you need it.

- Add the additions from these two lectures / walkthroughs to either the starter code above, or your existing game. 
    - [007-Tilemaps](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mwsu-Mobile-Gaming/blob/master/Lectures/007-Tilemaps.md)
    - [008-Mobile Friendly](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mwsu-Mobile-Gaming/blob/master/Lectures/008-MobileFriendly.md)

- Requirements:
    - Create a map using [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html) and incorporate it into your game. Your map MUST differ from the one in the assets folder so that I know you created it yourself.
    - Add all the changes from "[008-Mobile Friendly](https://github.com/rugbyprof/Mwsu-Mobile-Gaming/blob/master/Lectures/008-MobileFriendly.md)" to make your game mobile ready.
    - The only required change from the walkthrough is that you will need to find your own arrow images and use those instead. Do not use the arrows provided in the assets folder.
