### Program 5
- A randomly generated tilemap is generated
- Every re-load of the game creates a new instance in a random configuration with an entrance and exit
- A player (sprite) is loaded onto the map and can move around in the passageways
- Collision between sprite and walls must occur

### Program 6
- A player (dude) shows up on each instance of the game 
- The player is the same color of all instances
- When the original player moves, it is mirrored on each instance of the game
- Performance like lag or jerky behavior is ok
- Collision or addtional methods implemented is extra credit.

### Program 7
- A character that moves around and captures coins
- Each coin adds to the players score
- When the player drops through the floor it will start the new level
- The new level looks noticeably different from the previous level
- The new level shows the current score (not zero)
- The combined score (total) is shown at the end of the game.
